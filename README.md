Hello, This is my Siamese network test work.
With caffenet training on LFW dataset.

I can get about 80% accuracy on LFW dataset.

I think it's not enough for bussiness use, some measures should be still make to improve the accuracy.

A following paper suggest the multi-scale CNN architecture and OPMS algorithm maybe help:
